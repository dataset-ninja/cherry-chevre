**Cherry Chevre: A Fine-Grained Dataset for Goat Detection in Natural Environments** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the livestock industry. 

The dataset consists of 6159 images with 35364 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*goat*).

Images in the Cherry Chevre dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (4907 images), *test* (636 images), and *val* (616 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 data acquisition sources: ***tracking*** (2400 images), ***timelaps camera*** (2327 images), ***phantom3*** (846 images), ***external*** (296 images), and ***crosscall*** (290 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***subfolder*** tag. Images with ***tracking*** source have ***2023*** or ***2022*** tag. The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">INRAe, France</span>.
